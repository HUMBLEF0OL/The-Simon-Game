## HISTORY
    The Father of the Video Game was also the inventor of Simon. 
    Inventor Ralph Baer is best known for developing the first video game system, but he accomplished far more. 
    Named for the children’s game of “Simon Says,” the game was inspired by an Atari arcade game called Touch Me.

## TECHNOLOGY USED
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - jQuery

## INSTRUCTIONS
    - Like Touch Me, Simon had four different colored buttons. 
    - Each button played a unique note. 
    - Players had to be able to repeat an increasingly long string of tones that Simon created. 
    - If you got the order wrong, you lost.
